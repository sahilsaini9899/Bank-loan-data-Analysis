# Bank-loan-data-Analysis
Abstract
In this project we have analysed a bank loan data containing information of individuals applying for a
loan. We have done data cleaning by label encoding, missing value imputations using KNN and Logistic
regression, outlier detection, used quantile-based 
ooring and capping technique to get rid of outliers and
have used and compared three classiers- Logistic regression, SVM and Nave Bayes used for classication
problem. We have performed bivariate data analysis with the help of pie-charts and heat map. Through our
analysis, by drawing insights from the data, we have drawn conclusions regarding defaulters i.e., when is a
loan applicant most likely to be a defaulter. We have provided some recommendations to the bank regarding
the changes to be made in their guidelines and whether the bank must change their approval standards or
maintain the same approach regarding loans.
